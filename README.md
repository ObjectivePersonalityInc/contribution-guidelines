# Contribution Guidelines (Draft)

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰  
Weâ€™re excited you want to contribute to **Objective Personality**. These guidelines explain how we collaborate as a community so that everyone feels respected, safe, and aligned.  

---

## 1. Who Can Contribute
Anyone with skills, time, or ideas is welcome. Contributions may include:  
- Writing code, scripts, or technical tools  
- Research, testing, and experimentation  
- Writing articles, documentation, or educational materials  
- Design (visual, UX, branding)  
- Community support, events, or organizing  

All types of contributions are valued equally.  

---

## 2. Confidentiality
Because we sometimes work with non-public ideas, all contributors sign an NDA.  
- You may only use project information for the purpose of contributing.  
- Do not share outside the community unless we officially make it public.  

---

## 3. Intellectual Property (IP)
To keep things clear and consistent:  
- Any contributions you make to the project â€” whether code, design, writing, research, or other materials â€” become the property of **Objective Personality** once submitted.  
- You will always receive credit and recognition for your work.  
- If financial rewards are offered for certain contributions, those arrangements will be handled separately and are not covered by these guidelines.  

---

## 4. How We Work Together
- **Respect first**: We value inclusivity, kindness, and constructive feedback.  
- **Be clear**: Explain your ideas, changes, or contributions so others can understand.  
- **Collaborate openly**: Important decisions are discussed in the open.  
- **Keep it manageable**: Break down large contributions into smaller steps.  

---

## 5. Recognition
We want to celebrate contributors. Your name may appear in project documentation, release notes, or community highlights when youâ€™ve made meaningful contributions.  

---

## 6. Leaving the Project
If you stop contributing, no problem â€” weâ€™re grateful for your time.  
- Your past contributions remain part of the project.  
- Confidentiality (per the NDA) continues to apply.  

---

## 7. Getting Started (TODO)
- Join the community on **[Discord/Slack/etc.]**  
- Check out **[GitHub/Docs/Issue Tracker/etc.]** for open tasks.  
- If unsure, just ask â€” weâ€™d rather help early than fix things later.

**Thanks for helping us grow this project and community. Weâ€™re building it together! ðŸš€**
